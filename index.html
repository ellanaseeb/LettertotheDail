        var message = `Dear Representative,

The Irish people already know that Israel is continuing to commit war crimes and genocide against the Palestinian people.

On Wednesday 22th November, you will vote on a resolution to:

- Assess whether Israel is, or is at serious risk of committing genocide, in line with this State’s legal obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention, by employing all means reasonably available.

- Demand that Israel lift the siege on Gaza, restoring food, water, electricity and medical supplies.

- Endorse the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement and review Irish procurement policies accordingly.

- Close Shannon Airport to the US military immediately, by banning US military and US military contracted aircraft, including troop carriers, from landing at the airport. 

- Impose targeted economic, financial, political and diplomatic sanctions on Benjamin Netanyahu and all Israeli government ministers, officials and military personnel who are involved in Israel's apartheid system; the unlawful murder of Palestinian civilians; ethnic cleansing; violating human rights or international law; administrative detention or any actions likely to involve war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, as defined in the Rome statute or Apartheid convention.

- Cease trading arms, military equipment and technology, surveillance and ‘dual use’ technology with Israel.

- Publicly recognise that international crimes against humanity, including the crime of apartheid are being committed by Israel against Palestinians in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

As my representative, I urge you to vote for this resolution. If you vote against it, you will not receive my vote again. 

I cannot give you my vote if you allow Ireland to remain complicit in a racist, apartheid regime and in the murder of children, babies and innocent people, whilst allowing Israel to break international human rights laws with impunity.

At this time, the people of Ireland are holding each individual TD to moral account and we will not re-elect those of you who fail us at this most important hour. 

The Irish people can see how each individual TD has voted on this matter during the course of this genocide and consider with utter contempt those of you who vote against Irish action for basic human rights. 

You represent the Irish people and you have an obvious mandate in this regard. We are telling you, in clear language, exactly what we need you to do this Wednesday. Do not fail humanity.

The anger of the Irish people is mounting. Your action is demanded now. Vote for this resolution or prepare to lose your seat in the next election. 

The following breaches of international law deem these sanctions and actions necessary:

- Israel has murdered over 6,400 children and babies, including premature babies.

- Israel has murdered over 15,000 people, with at least 3,000 still trapped under rubble, half of which are children. This equates to one murder every 4 minutes for the past 43 days.

- Israel has attacked and injured almost 30,000 civilians, more than half of them women and children.

- Israel is starving over 2 million besieged Gazan people of food, water, fuel and medicine, denying them their most fundamental human rights. Many are preventably dying of dehydration, starvation and disease because Israel continues to withhold their water and food supplies.

- According to Médecins Sans Frontières, due to Israel’s criminal attack, the healthcare system in Gaza has collapsed and children are enduring surgeries, such as amputations, without anaesthetic.

- The WHO entered Al-Shifa Hospital for one hour, describing it as a death zone, forced to stop functioning as a medical facility, directly due to the withholding of clean water, fuel, medicines, food and other essential aid by Israel. There were signs of Israeli shelling and gunfire evident inside the hospital and a mass grave at the entrance. Surviving patients and medical staff were terrified for their lives at the hands of the Israeli military.

- Israel has invaded Gaza on the ground, where the Israeli soldiers are still shooting and killing with impunity. There is verified footage of tank shelling and arms fire in densely populated civilian streets, including so-called "safe zones". Civilians are dying from ground combat and the Israeli government has said it will continue this invasion with "full force". 

- Israel has deliberately bombed 21 hospitals, including intensive care units, 246 schools and education facilities, multiple mosques and churches, UN facilities and countless residential buildings with families inside. Israel continues to do so.

- Israel claims these places are where Hamas is hiding, but has not provided any verified evidence of this. It also claims to have killed 60 members of Hamas. With over 15,000 civilians dead, this is a 0.4% accuracy rate in targeted kills. That means that 99.6% of the people Israel has murdered are innocent. This is utterly foul and cannot be allowed to go unpunished or unanswered for.

- Israel has forced medical staff out of hospitals, where they have left sick and injured children and babies, including premature babies, alone to die.

- There is verified footage of Israeli snipers shooting medical staff as they exit hospitals holding up white flags.

- Israel is attacking first responders and ambulances during rescue efforts. 53 ambulances have been destroyed and over 200 medical staff murdered.

- Israel is deliberately killing journalists who actively expose their war crimes, alongside their families. At least 48 journalists are dead so far.

- Israel is ethnically cleansing Gaza of its native Palestinian population. This is one of many serious breaches of international human rights law by Israel.

- Israel has forcibly displaced over 1.7 million civilians and is bombing the designated "safe route". Both are war crimes.

- Israel has repeatedly attacked Rafah and the Rafah crossing, continually blocking fuel and almost all international aid, and killing civilians. Another war crime.

- Israel's illegal aggressions in the West Bank are also incredibly alarming and indicative of the apartheid regime Israel perpetuates. Israel has murdered at least 178 Palestinian  people here, including 45 children. Israel has displaced at least 1,000 Palestinian people in the West Bank, including 145 children. Israel has detained over 2,200 Palestinians in the West Bank, largely leading to indefinite administrative detention without trial. This is in addition to the 2,070 Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails already, many without fair trial and at least 160 of whom are children.

- The Israeli government have failed to investigate incidents of torture and death of Palestinians in their custody over the past month, as they are legally bound to do, by international law.

As my representative, I require you to note that no inspections have taken place by the Irish state to establish if US military aircraft landing in Shannon airport meet the State’s conditions that these military aircraft are unarmed and carry no arms, ammunition or explosives; are not engaged in intelligence gathering and do not form part of a military operation or exercise. Additionally, no inspections of US military aircraft in Shannon airport have taken place to establish if weapons are being transported to Israel since Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in October 2023.

I also require you to note that certain footage supplied by the Israeli government as proof of Hamas activity has been shown by verification teams at the BBC and other broadcasters to be false and staged. See the inconsistent and edited footage of two “Hamas guns” discovered at Al-Shifa Hospital. See also the weekly planner found at Al-Rantisi Children's Hospital, which Israel deemed “a terrorist list and rota of those guarding hostages”, but in fact, it simply listed the days of the week in Arabic. This raises many questions over the legitimacy of all that the Israeli government tells us. If they can create propaganda for their crimes and falsely call it evidence without any legal ramifications, what else do they lie to us about?

Lastly, I require you to note that according to survivor testimony and official footage released by the Israeli government, many of the Israeli civilians killed on October 7th were in fact shot with IDF bullets. Apache helicopter pilots have admitted to firing continuously without intelligence on targets, while tank crews have confirmed they were ordered to shell homes, regardless of whether there were Israelis inside or not. See the testimony of Israeli survivor Yasmin Porat and drone footage from the Israeli government for clarification. Israel’s influential finance minister and settler leader, Bezalel Smotrich, urged the Israeli army to “hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration” during a cabinet meeting late on October 7th as the Hamas attack was still underway. This echoes the controversial "Hannibal Directive" Israeli officials used to justify any means to prevent the capture of IDF soldiers.

Additionally Israeli hostages report being treated with dignity by Hamas fighters. See the full testimony of Yocheved Lifshitz for clarification. She reports that Hamas fighters told the hostages "they would not harm us", a doctor tended to them regularly, that good care was taken of the wounded and that "they treated us gently and met all our needs."

These reports stand in stark contrast to the dominant narrative in the West and sharply highlight the lack of accuracy of Western reporting and the bias within our Irish media. The citizens of Ireland will not stand for this lack of truth.

Directly compare these testimonies with the inhumane and degrading treatment of Palestinian prisoners in the West Bank by the Israeli military. This treatment includes severely beating, starving, stripping, blindfolding, tying up and urinating on Palestinian prisoners, evidenced in video footage and interviews, both conducted and verified by Amnesty International.

Any rhetoric suggesting that the actions listed fall under "Israel's right to self-defence" is a moral, legal and political failure. Furthermore, there is a debate as to whether it’s possible for a settler-colony to self-defend, or is this simply a euphemism for furthering colonial occupation. Regardless, what Israel is doing is categorically not self-defence. War crimes and crimes against humanity must be answered for.

I urge you to pass this resolution. Unequivocally condemn the Israeli apartheid regime and investigate this genocide. Vote to impose economic, financial, political and diplomatic sanctions on Israel. Vote to close Shannon airport to the US military. Vote to endorse the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement with state policies. Vote to call for Israel to end their total blockade of the Gaza strip. Vote for humanity.

Sincerely,
`;

        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel has&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">murdered</span></strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&nbsp;over&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">15,000 people</span></strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">, with at least 3,000 still trapped under rubble, half of which are children.&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">This equates to one murder every 4 minutes for the past 43 days.</span></strong></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel has attacked and&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">injured</span></strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&nbsp;almost&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">30,000 civilians</span></strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">, more than half of them women and children.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel is&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">starving over 2 million besieged Gazan people</span></strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&nbsp;of food, water, fuel and medicine, denying them their most fundamental human rights. Many are preventably dying of dehydration, starvation and disease because Israel continues to withhold their water and food supplies.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- According to M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, due to Israel&rsquo;s criminal attack, the healthcare system in Gaza has collapsed and children are enduring surgeries, such as amputations, without anaesthetic.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- The WHO entered Al-Shifa Hospital for one hour, describing it as a death zone, forced to stop functioning as a medical facility, directly due to the withholding of clean water, fuel, medicines, food and other essential aid by Israel. There were signs of Israeli shelling and gunfire evident inside the hospital and a mass grave at the entrance. Surviving patients and medical staff were terrified for their lives at the hands of the Israeli military.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel has invaded Gaza on the ground, where the Israeli soldiers are still shooting and killing with impunity. There is verified footage of tank shelling and arms fire in densely populated civilian streets, including so-called &quot;safe zones&quot;. Civilians are dying from ground combat and the Israeli government has said it will continue this invasion with &quot;full force&quot;.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel has deliberately bombed 21 hospitals, including intensive care units, 246 schools and education facilities, multiple mosques and churches, UN facilities and countless residential buildings with families inside. Israel continues to do so.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel claims these places are where Hamas is hiding, but has not provided any verified evidence of this. It also claims to have killed 60 members of Hamas. With over 15,000 civilians dead, this is a 0.4% accuracy rate in targeted kills. That means that 99.6% of the people Israel has murdered are innocent. This is utterly foul and cannot be allowed to go unpunished or unanswered for.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel has forced medical staff out of hospitals, where they have left sick and injured children and babies, including premature babies, alone to die.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- There is verified footage of Israeli snipers shooting medical staff as they exit hospitals holding up white flags.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel is attacking first responders and ambulances during rescue efforts. 53 ambulances have been destroyed and over 200 medical staff murdered.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel is deliberately killing journalists who actively expose their war crimes, alongside their families. At least 48 journalists are dead so far.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel is ethnically cleansing Gaza of its native Palestinian population. This is one of many serious breaches of international human rights law by Israel.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel has forcibly displaced over 1.7 million civilians and is bombing the designated &quot;safe route&quot;. Both are war crimes.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel has repeatedly attacked Rafah and the Rafah crossing, continually blocking fuel and almost all international aid, and killing civilians. Another war crime.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- Israel&apos;s illegal aggressions in the West Bank are also incredibly alarming and indicative of the apartheid regime Israel perpetuates. Israel has murdered at least 178 Palestinian</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;">people here, including 45 children. Israel has displaced at least 1,000 Palestinian people in the West Bank, including 145 children. Israel has detained over 2,200 Palestinians in the West Bank, largely leading to indefinite administrative detention without trial. This is in addition to the 2,070 Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails already, many without fair trial and at least 160 of whom are children.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">- The Israeli government have failed to investigate incidents of torture and death of Palestinians in their custody over the past month, as they are legally bound to do, by international law.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">As my representative, I require you to note that no inspections have taken place by the Irish state to establish if US military aircraft landing in Shannon airport meet the State&rsquo;s conditions that these military aircraft are unarmed and carry no arms, ammunition or explosives; are not engaged in intelligence gathering and do not form part of a military operation or exercise. Additionally, no inspections of US military aircraft in Shannon airport have taken place to establish if weapons are being transported to Israel since Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in October 2023.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">I also require you to note that certain footage supplied by the Israeli government as proof of Hamas activity has been shown by verification teams at the BBC and other broadcasters to be false and staged. See the inconsistent and edited footage of two &ldquo;Hamas guns&rdquo; discovered at Al-Shifa Hospital. See also the weekly planner found at Al-Rantisi Children&apos;s Hospital, which Israel deemed &ldquo;a terrorist list and rota of those guarding hostages&rdquo;, but in fact, it simply listed the days of the week in Arabic. This raises many questions over the legitimacy of all that the Israeli government tells us. If they can create propaganda for their crimes and falsely call it evidence without any legal ramifications, what else do they lie to us about?</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Lastly, I require you to note that according to survivor testimony and official footage released by the Israeli government, many of the Israeli civilians killed on October 7th were in fact shot with IDF bullets. Apache helicopter pilots have admitted to firing continuously without intelligence on targets, while tank crews have confirmed they were ordered to shell homes, regardless of whether there were Israelis inside or not. See the testimony of Israeli survivor Yasmin Porat and drone footage from the Israeli government for clarification. Israel&rsquo;s influential finance minister and settler leader, Bezalel Smotrich, urged the Israeli army to &ldquo;hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration&rdquo; during a cabinet meeting late on October 7th as the Hamas attack was still underway. This echoes the controversial &quot;Hannibal Directive&quot; Israeli officials used to justify any means to prevent the capture of IDF soldiers.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Additionally Israeli hostages report being treated with dignity by Hamas fighters. See the full testimony of Yocheved Lifshitz for clarification. She reports that Hamas fighters told the hostages &quot;they would not harm us&quot;, a doctor tended to them regularly, that good care was taken of the wounded and that &quot;they treated us gently and met all our needs.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">These reports stand in stark contrast to the dominant narrative in the West and sharply highlight the lack of accuracy of Western reporting and the bias within our Irish media.&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The citizens of Ireland will not stand for this lack of truth.</span></strong></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Directly compare these testimonies with the inhumane and degrading treatment of Palestinian prisoners in the West Bank by the Israeli military. This treatment includes severely beating, starving, stripping, blindfolding, tying up and urinating on Palestinian prisoners, evidenced in video footage and interviews, both conducted and verified by Amnesty International.</span></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Any rhetoric suggesting that the actions listed fall under&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&quot;Israel&apos;s right to self-defence&quot; is a moral, legal and political failure.</span></strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&nbsp;Furthermore, there is a debate as to whether it&rsquo;s possible for a settler-colony to self-defend, or is this simply a euphemism for furthering colonial occupation. Regardless, what Israel is doing is categorically not self-defence.&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">War crimes and crimes against humanity must be answered for.</span></strong></p>
        <p class="normal0" style="line-height:115%; font-size:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">I urge you to pass this resolution.</span></strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&nbsp;Unequivocally condemn the Israeli apartheid regime and investigate this genocide. Vote to impose economic, financial, political and diplomatic sanctions on Israel. Vote to close Shannon airport to the US military. Vote to endorse the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement with state policies. Vote to call for Israel to end their total blockade of the Gaza strip.&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Vote for humanity.</span></strong></p>
